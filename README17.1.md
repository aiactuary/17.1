# Practical Application 17.1 â€” Comparing Classifiers (Bank Marketing)

**Notebook:** [Practical_Application_17_1_Bank_Marketing.ipynb](Practical_Application_17_1_Bank_Marketing.ipynb)
**Data:** bank-additional-full.csv

## Summary of Findings
This project compares **KNN**, **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **SVM** to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (`y`) from the UCI Bank Marketing dataset.

- **Business goal:** Improve call efficiency by prioritizing customers with higher subscription propensity.
- **Primary metric:** **ROC AUC** (rank-ordering ability). Secondary: **Recall**, **Precision**, **F1**, **Accuracy**.
- **Result overview:** After cross-validated grid search, the top-performing model (by AUC) is identified in the results table. ROC curves and confusion matrices are provided. Threshold tuning shows the precision/recall trade-off to meet campaign goals.
- **Key drivers:** Logistic coefficients and tree importances highlight features associated with higher conversion likelihood (e.g., contact type, prior outcome, month). Consider treatment of **`duration`** carefully due to potential leakage if used before a call is completed.

## Data & Preparation
- Dataset: `bank-additional-full.csv` (UCI Bank Marketing).
- Steps: Missing value checks, type handling, one-hot encoding for categoricals, standardization for numerics via a `ColumnTransformer` in a pipeline.
- Split: Stratified train/test (80/20).

## Modeling Approach
- Models: KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM.
- Validation: 5-fold cross-validated **GridSearchCV** on pipelines for fair preprocessing across models.
- Evaluation: AUC comparison + secondary metrics at default and tuned probability thresholds.

## Visualizations
- Seaborn EDA: target distribution, categorical counts, continuous distributions, boxplots, correlation heatmap, and subplots.
- Model diagnostics: ROC curves and confusion matrices.

## Findings
- The business problem was to identify customers most likely to subscribe to a bank product following a marketing campaign.
- After testing multiple models, **Logistic Regression achieved the highest AUC (~0.94)**, showing the best ability to rank positive cases above negative ones.
- While SVM performed similarly well, AUC is a threshold-independent metric and indicates Logistic Regression is the most reliable model overall.

- **Next steps:** refine feature engineering (e.g., handling `pdays` more carefully, dropping leakage-prone features like `duration`), try ensemble methods, and consider calibration for probability outputs to support business decision thresholds.

## Actionable insight
- **Targeting:** Using Logistic Regression predictions to prioritize customer calls could improve campaign efficiency and reduce wasted effort.
- **Operations:** Select a threshold aligned with budgeted call volume and desired recall of positives.
- **Policy:** Monitor fairness across key demographics; adjust targeting rules as needed.

## Next Steps
1. Incorporate **cost-sensitive** thresholding (expected value vs. call costs).
2. Use **time-based splits** to reflect campaign chronology.
3. Provide **explanations** to agents (top features per lead).
